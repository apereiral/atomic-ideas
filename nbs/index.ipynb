    "Almost 10 years ago, Bret Victor gave a talk where he argued that we should build tools for thinking unthinkable thoughts. If this sentence alone had you wonder \"what does he mean by 'unthinkable thoughts'?\" or even \"if the thoughts are unthinkable, how can we possibly build tools to think them?\", I highly recommend that you go watch his full talk. It is 40 minutes long, but it is totally worth it. Nevertheless, I'll try to summarize the argument as much as I can without failing it.\n",
